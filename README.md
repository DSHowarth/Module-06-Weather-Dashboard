## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Jquery
- Bootstrap
- DayJS

## Lessons Learned
- When storing entries piecemeal in an array, you need to store the first entry as 
a singular array in order to .push() new entries later
- It is much easier to put an event delegation trigger on the element you're 
dynamically appending new elements onto, rather than create a new trigger for each.
- The more modular you can make your functions, the easier your code will be to work with as it balloons in scope
